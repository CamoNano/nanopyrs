* Changed APIs
    * `dangerous_clone` on `SecretBytes` and `Scalar` has been removed in favor of implementing `Clone`
    * Renamed some variants of `NanoError` to improve clarity
    * Removed unused variant of `RpcError`
    * The stealth account protocol versions have been shifted by one from 0 -> 7 to 1 -> 8. The "new" version `1` is the "old" version `0`, and is identical in all but name
    * `StealthAccountVersions::new` now takes `&[u8]`, rather than `Vec<u8>`
    * Added `rpc::debug`, containing `DebugRpc` and `Response<T>`, to allow access to raw json requests and responses
* Added more documentation
* Added more tests
